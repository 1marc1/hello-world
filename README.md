# hello-world
My first github project.
This is my hello-world file.
As requested by one of our many users, here is the elaboration in the readme file. The purpose of this repository is to explore how github works. We do this by means of following an example. The example has created this readme file. There is nothing special to it.

In the future we can write some more details, but for now it is good enough.
